# calcplugins
A collection of my plugins for [ImaginaryInfinity-Calculator](https://github.com/TurboWafflz/ImaginaryInfinity-Calculator). All of my plugins come with a ``*pluginname*.help()`` function to get you started.

----

## formulas
The formulas plugin is a plugin that adds the functionality to solve lots of formulas. Some include but are not limited to, volume of shapes, quadratic formula, and energy equations.

## absgraph
Absgraph is a plugin that will give you the equation to an Absolute Value Graph from the x value, y value, and slope.

## quads
The quads plugin will find information on a parabolla from the quadratic equation.

## ptable
The ptable plugin just provides data from the periodic table. Right now, every element has a mass, a number, and a melting point value. More values may be added in the future.

## odds
The odds plugin is fairly simple. All it does it take an input of numbers and splits them into 2 lists, even numbers and odd numbers. It will tell you how many of each there are and you can also get it to show all of the split numbers.

## themegui
Make themes with a Tkinter GUI.

**Note**: themegui currently has an issue that stops `ctrl + c` from working in the calculator because of Tkinter. Remove or disable the plugin to regain this functionality.
